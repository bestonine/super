    <h1>Building the Future of Browser Gaming</h1>
    <p style="max-width:800px;margin:16px auto 0;font-size:1.15em">VELOCITY CRASH represents a bold vision: delivering AAA gaming experiences without downloads, installations, or compromise. We're a team of engineers, designers, and racing enthusiasts united by one belief—gaming should be instant, accessible, and extraordinary.</p>

    <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.05em;line-height:1.7">
      VELOCITY CRASH was born from frustration. As avid gamers, we grew tired of waiting for massive downloads, dealing with incompatible platforms, and watching friends miss out on great games because of hardware limitations. We asked ourselves: what if we could build something different?
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.05em;line-height:1.7;margin-top:16px">
      In early 2024, our founding team—three game developers, two physics engineers, and a UX designer—locked themselves in a garage with a simple mission: create a racing game that runs flawlessly in any browser, on any device, with zero compromise on quality. Eighteen months, countless Red Bulls, and 50,000 lines of optimized JavaScript later, VELOCITY CRASH emerged.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.05em;line-height:1.7;margin-top:16px">
      What started as a passion project has grown into a thriving platform with over 50,000 active players worldwide. But we're just getting started. Every day, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible with web technology, proving that the future of gaming isn't locked behind app stores or expensive hardware—it's right here in your browser.

    <h2>The Technology Behind the Thrill</h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.05em;margin-bottom:24px">
      Building a high-performance racing game that runs entirely in the browser isn't easy. Here's a glimpse into our technical philosophy and the innovations that make VELOCITY CRASH possible:

      <div style="margin-bottom:24px">
        <strong style="display:block;font-size:1.1em;margin-bottom:8px">⚡ Custom Canvas Rendering Engine</strong>
        <p style="margin:0;opacity:0.9;line-height:1.6">
          We built our rendering engine from scratch using HTML5 Canvas API, optimizing every draw call for maximum performance. Our engine handles complex particle systems, dynamic lighting, and real-time shadows without sacrificing frame rate.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom:24px">
        <strong style="display:block;font-size:1.1em;margin-bottom:8px">🔢 Real-Time Physics Simulation</strong>
        <p style="margin:0;opacity:0.9;line-height:1.6">
          Using advanced collision detection algorithms and rigid body dynamics, we simulate realistic vehicle behavior and crash physics. Every collision calculates momentum transfer, angular velocity, and material deformation in real-time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom:24px">
        <strong style="display:block;font-size:1.1em;margin-bottom:8px">🌐 WebSocket Multiplayer Infrastructure</strong>
        <p style="margin:0;opacity:0.9;line-height:1.6">
          Our multiplayer system uses WebSockets for ultra-low latency communication, combined with client-side prediction and server reconciliation to ensure smooth gameplay even on unstable connections.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong style="display:block;font-size:1.1em;margin-bottom:8px">📦 Aggressive Asset Optimization</strong>
        <p style="margin:0;opacity:0.9;line-height:1.6">
          Through procedural generation, texture atlasing, and compression techniques, we've reduced our initial payload to under 2MB. Additional assets load progressively in the background, keeping initial load times under 3 seconds on 4G connections.
